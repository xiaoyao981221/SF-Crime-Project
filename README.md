# SF-Crime-Project
The series of notebooks consist of the analyses of the dataset of crime incidents in SF  
(accessed from: https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-Historical-2003/tmnf-yvry/data) through the application of data science tools, including pandas (table manipulation), folium (geospatial analysis tool) and scikit-learn (machine learning algorithms).
